# BFS-Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualizer
JavaFX desktop application

#Why I chose this project?
When I browse the internet most of the time I spend my time in youtube watching educational channels.
The idea of creating a pathfinding visualizer came from a youtuber called Cl√©ment Mihailescu.
He created a pathfinding visualization tool for various of algorithms using JavaScript and React!
I really loved his project so I tried to recreate a part of his using the technology I know - Java!
